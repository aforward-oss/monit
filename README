 QUICK START
 -----------
 
 This readme serves as a quick start, please use `man monit' for
 documentation on the program.
 
 
 Installation:
 -------------
 
   -  ./configure
   -  make
   -  make install
   -  man monit
 
 This will install Monit and the man-file in /usr/local/bin and
 /usr/local/man/man1 respectively. If you want another location than
 /usr/local, run configure with the prefix options, like so:
 ./configure --prefix=<dir>
 
 
 Notes:
 ------
 
 - This directory contains an example Monit control file, called
   monitrc. Please read it and use it as a starting point when you
   write your own Monit control file.
 
 - Monit will probably work on most Unix systems. However, Monit is
   tested and known to compile and operate on: Darwin, Linux, FreeBSD,
   NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.
